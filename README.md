# rubiks-cube
Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW4eyNniSGo
This is a rubik cube solver, using arduino and two steppers. This was really a fun project where I got to know some new tools. The final model is not perfect and not how I wanted it to be though. For now this is a rule-based system and I hope to improve it with the NN implementation.
